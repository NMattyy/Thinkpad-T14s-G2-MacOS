## MacOS Support

This section only cover general compatibility of MacOS. I have not tested every version. For compatibility status see [Status](https://github.com/NMattyy/Thinkpad-T14s-G2-MacOS/?tab=readme-ov-file#-status).                                          
`SMBIOS: MacBookPro16,3`                       
`Min version: Catalina 10.15.x` `Max Version: Tahoe 26.x`                      
`Recommended: Ventura 13.x`                             

| Version              |  Note                 |
| -------------------- |  -------------------- |
| Catalina 10.15       |  Could have some issue with NootedRed | 
| Big Sur 11           |                       | 
| Monterey 12          |                       | 
| Ventura 13           |                       | 
| Sonoma 14            | Noticebly more unstable than previous version because of NootedRed | 
| Sequoia 15           | Noticebly more unstable than previous version because of NootedRed | 
| Tahoe 26 `BETA`      | Noticebly more unstable than previous version because of NootedRed. No interal audio support (At the moment) | 

The CPU could, actually, support `High Sierra 10.13` and superior but, as there's no way to get proper Graphics acceleration, as NootedRed does not support anything below `Catalina 10.15`, I counted them as `Unsupported`

## Pre-setup

You must have a usb stick formatted in `FAT32` where you put OpenCore and the MacOS recovery.           
You must use your Target Laptop to set up your SSDT and USB and you should have a second PC for troubleshooting.
You should update your BIOS before trying to install MacOS.        
Download [OpenCore debug](https://github.com/acidanthera/opencorepkg/releases) (This will provide us more logs to help us troubleshooting in case of problems.)     
Download [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (a .plist editor)       
Download [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (to generate your SMBIOS)      
In Windows Download [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (to generate your SSDT)        
In Windows Download [USBToolBox](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool/releases/tag/0.2) (to map your USB)

## Setup

You can either follow [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/) and [ChefKiss](https://chefkissinc.github.io/guides/hackintosh/) guides (Highly recommended)
or you can follow these steps (Not recommended because this refer to my personal experience that could not be the same as yours, even with the same laptop resulting in errors.)

#### Initial EFI setup         
Download MacOS recovery using [Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/windows-install.html)      
You can install every MacOS version from Catalina to Sequoia (Recommended Ventura as it is the most stable so far)      
From the `OpenCore.zip` you've just downloaded, take the `EFI` folder from the `X64` folder and put it on your USB stick.        
Into the `EFI` you have 2 folder, open the `OC` one then you will have another 5 folders, from the `Drivers` one you have to delete everthing except for `OpenRuntime.efi` and you have to download [HFSPlus.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData/blob/master/Drivers/HfsPlus.efi).      
Then, you have to go on the `Tools` folder. Here you have to delete everything except for `UEFIShell.efi` (You can also keep `CleanNVRAM.efi` to reset the NVRAM but note that it is known to brick some thinkpads making them unbootable so i would prefer not to.) I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSABILITY IF YOU BREAK YOUR LAPTOP.     

#### Kext folder setup        
You have to download the following kextd and put them into your `Kexts` folder :
| Kext        |  Note             |
| --------    | ----------------- |
| [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)   |                   |
| [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases)  | From the zip folder that you get when you download this kext you have to also pick `SMCBattery`                |
| [SMCRadeonSensors](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/SMCRadeonSensors/releases)            | Optional |
| [NootedRed](https://nightly.link/ChefKissInc/NootedRed/workflows/main/master/Artifacts.zip)            | Could cause some problem on Sonoma+ so, while installing, disable It    | 
| [AppleALC](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/releases)            | You can use `alcid=11` as codec in your boot-args       |
|  [RTL8111](https://github.com/Mieze/RTL8111_driver_for_OS_X/releases)           | Use version `2.4.2` as version `2.5.0` is not meant for AMD CPUs |
| [Itlwm or AirportItlwm](https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/)    | If you're installing Ventura or lower you can use AirportItlwm as it enables native wifi but, if you're installing Sonoma+, itlwm + heliport is reccomended (Read the guide from the link to understand better)       |
| [OpenIntelBluetooth](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/releases) | On macOS 12+ you need to use IntelBluetoothFirmware and IntelBTPatcher from the zip that you just downloaded, and BlueToolFixup from [BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM/releases). |
|[VoodooPS2](https://github.com/acidanthera/VoodooPS2/releases) ||
| [VoodooI2C](https://github.com/VoodooI2C/VoodooI2C/releases) | This enables just trackpad but, If you want, you can also add VoodooI2CHID to also enables touchscreen. |
| [NVMeFix](https://github.com/acidanthera/NVMeFix/releases) | |
| [AppleMCEReporterDisabler](https://chefkissinc.github.io/Extras/Kexts/AppleMCEReporterDisabler.zip) | |
| [ForgedInvariant](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/ForgedInvariant/releases) | |
| [ECEnabler](https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler/releases) | |
| [BrightnessKeys](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrightnessKeys) | |

#### Map your USB     
In Windows, download USBToolBox, extract It and open `windows.exe`. Go in the settings and enable `Native Classes` then,
select `Discover Ports` and plug a USB 3 device and a USB 2 device in each port. Once you're done with mapping, go to
`Select Ports`, adjust anything that is not set correct and then press `K` to build the kext then, put it into your `kext` folder.

#### Config.plist setup
From the `OpenCorePKG` folder, open the `docs` folder then copy the `sample.plist` file and put it on your usb stick into the `OC` folder, then rename it into `config.plist`.
Now, follow [Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/AMD/zen.html) to setup your `config.plist`.

#### SSDT creation     
In Windows, download SSDTTime, extract It and open `SSDTTime.bat`.        
Dump your ACPI table pressing `P`.   
Then, you have to choose this options.   
`USBX` (Choose B).   
`RTCAWAC` (If It says that you do not need It, skip It.).  
`PluginType`   
`USB Reset`   
`FakeEC Laptop`  
`XOSI` (Choose A)  
`PNLF`   
`ALS0`     
Now, go into the `Results` folder and take every `.aml` file and put it into your `OC/ACPI` folder. Now, from the `SSDTTime` folder use the `PatchMerge.bat` file to merge your `config.plist` with the patch that SSDTTime created for you then, go to ProperTree again and perform an `OC Snapshot`.

## Troubleshooting

You will likely get stuck at `[EB|#LOG:EXITBS:START]` so you have to follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/extended/kernel-issues.html#booter-issues). 
For my experience, you just have to set `EnableWriteUnprotector -> True`, `RebuildAppleMemoryMap -> False` and `SyncRuntimePermissions -> False`, then MacOS Recovery will boot (If you need to dualboot windows using opencore you have to set `SyncRuntimePermissions -> True`. Should not work but... it does.)

If you're using `Itlwm` instead of `AirportItlwm`, in Recovery, you won't initially have access to the Wifi panel, as you can't use Heliport, so you have to edit the `info.plist` that you find inside `itlwm.kext`to manually add your WIFI info into the configuration to allow `Itlwm` to connect to it without Heliport. If you can't get it to work and you can't use your ethernet, if you have an android device you can use as usb tethering, you can install [HoRNDIS.kext](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oBKn5JwKisGOaADY5dE85-coVNqXrkFx/view).

## Post-Install

#### Bluetooth issues      
For Monterey and older, if you followed the guide, It should work Out Of The Box, but if you installed Ventura+ you have to do some trouble shooting.      
Go into your `NVRAM>7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82` section on your `.plist` file and add this under the corrispondent `Add` and `Delete` sections:      

| Key        |  Type              |  Value            |
| --------    | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| bluetoothInternalControllerInfo | Data | 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000 |
| bluetoothExternalDongleFailed   | Data | 00 |

For Sonoma and older, if adding the NVRAM values does not work, you can try adding `-btlfxnvramcheck` in your boot-args.                                                                 
For Sequoia and newer, if adding the NVRAM values does not work, you can try adding `-btlfxallowanyaddr` `-btlfxboardid` in your boot-args.

Now your bluetooth should work properly.          

#### Crashing apps issue   
Install [AMDHelper](https://github.com/alvindimas05/AMDHelper) and enable the patches that you need for the apps that don't work/chromium based apps that cause graphical issues with NootedRed.

#### YogaSMC features

If you want to to have fan and sensors reading, fan control and other thinkpad's features that you have on windows like battery conservation or full function keys functionality, you can install [YogaSMC](https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC)

Requires some addittional SSDT that you have to compile by yourself using your `DSDT.aml` and the example SSDTs that are available on their site.

## 🔧 Status

> [!NOTE]
>
>I firstly installed ventura and then I upgraded to Sequoia and I did not test any other version but everything in this status should apply to every MacOS version you installable on this Thinkpad. Let me know if It is not so.
> 
> - Working = Works out of the box or with some troubleshooting 
> - Partially Working = Working but with some occasional problems
> - Not Working = Does not work and probably never will
> - Not Tested = Not tested but would probably works
>
> This applies only to stable releases.


### ✔️ Working
- GPU acceleration and backlight control
- Audio + Jack + HDMI Audio
- Keyboard, Trackpoint and Trackpad's buttons
- Wifi (Trough AirportItlwm in Ventura and Itlwm + Heliport in Sequoia)
- Bluetooth (See [Bluetooth issue](https://github.com/NMattyy/Thinkpad-T14s-G2-MacOS?tab=readme-ov-file#bluetooth-issues))
- HDMI
- Function keys
- USB

### ⚠️ Partially Working

- PowerManagement (No official PowerManagement is supported but, as firmware do the big job and you can also do some other adjustment using amdHelper's battery optimization, you can have a semi-great PowerManagement even though battery life is worse than windows.)
- Proper Standby functionality (I couldn't get MacOS to go into sleep mode while using `Modern Standby or Windows Standby` so I had to switch back into `S3 Standby or Linux Standby` in the bios. Other than that, stanby works.)
- Trackpad and Touchscreen (They actually work pretty well but they work inconsistently as, occasionally, they just don't work and you have to restart the entire system to get them to work. Right now I don't really know what's causing that issue.)

### ❌ Not Working
- Internal mic (Could work if you switch from AppleALC to [VoodooHDA](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/VoodooHDA). Note that the quality of the audio of the speakers will be lower if you switch to VoodooHDA)
- Internal camera
- Battery treshold (It could probably work. I think that, probably, my YogaSMC's SSDTs are just bad.)

### ❓ Not Tested
- USB-C display port
- LAN with Dock extension connector
- SmartCard reader
